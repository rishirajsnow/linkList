//Link list- It is a linear data structure. bUt it is not a contiguous data structure.

//Static Memory- Allocating memmory at compile time.
// Dynamic memory- Allocating memory at run time.


// Draw back to array -> Contiguous memory is required.If contiguous memory is not avilable then it will not Work.
// By default array is static.
// Some we need to access dynamic memory , we use Link List.

// Array-> traversal is faster -> O(1)
// LL -> Allocation is faster, traversal is slower
